We specialise in finding the right words to meet your needs. Over the years we have found that your needs might not always fit neatly into one of our service categories. For example, we have been engaged to write copy for mobile phone apps, to re-write white papers for companies seeking investment, we have written application letters and copy edited PhD proposals, we have even helped people with speeches. The point is that we believe we can help you regardless of the nature of your communications need, which is why we created this category.

There are many of you out there achieving great things, and we know that you may not have the time, or indeed the aptitude, to produce suitable text. Thatâ€™s where we come in. [Get in touch](/contact), outline what it is that you need, and we can take it from there.

Let *us* worry about the words.
