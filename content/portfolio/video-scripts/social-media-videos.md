The script for Century Office Supplies is a great example of the short form promotional videos often use by companies to promote themselves throughout social media platforms. As is often the case for these videos, the challenge as a writer is to provide a concept that is both memorable and catchy, while also allowing for inexpensive production. These taglines and concepts should be repeatable with different visuals, as was the case for this campaign.
