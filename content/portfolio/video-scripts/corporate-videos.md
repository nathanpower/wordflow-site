Corporate video scripts require a particular finesse that differs from consumer targeted promotional materials. It is about representing the company and its ethos in a way that resonates with both prospective employees as well as potential business partners. These kinds of videos must be descriptive of the status quo while also looking to the future, they should pay homage to past achievements while signalling more to come, and they should encapsulate an organisationâ€™s motivation in a way that makes a lasting impression.
