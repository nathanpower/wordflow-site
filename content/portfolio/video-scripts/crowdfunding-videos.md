There is a growing trend of small to medium sized enterprises seeking to crowdfund investment in order to expand their business. This provides the particular challenge of finding copy that communicates what is often large amounts of detailed information in a short amount of time. Add to this the need for it to be presented in a way that holds the viewers attention and you have a unique copy-writing challenge.
