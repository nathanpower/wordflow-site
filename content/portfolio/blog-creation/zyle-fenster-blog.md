Zyle Fenster is a great example of question to answer blog creation. This is a process of seeking out what it is that potential customers want to know about an industry, in this case the window industry. Armed with that information, we write engaging blogs to answer these questions. This will not only make for great posts throughout social media and new website content, but may also be found organically by those actively searching for your relevant products. Optically, this will give your business the impression of being at the forefront of your industry, as well as driving up your organic ranking through the flow of relevant traffic.
