Between running a medical practice and regular speaking engagements, Dr. Mark is an extremely busy man. He has a lot to say, but little time to write. To remedy this, he would provide us with notes about his ideas and initiatives. We then took these notes and reshaped them into engaging material for his followers to enjoy, and of course, to increase his visibility in the world of self-care.
