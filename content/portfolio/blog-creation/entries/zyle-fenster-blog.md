Zyle Fenster is a great example of question to answer blog creation. This is a process of seeking out what it is that potential customers want to know about an industry, in this case the window industry. Armed with that information, we write engaging dynamic blogs to answer these questions. This, will not only make for great posts throughout social media as well as great new website content (important for ranking), but may also be found organically by those actively searching for your relevant products. Optically, this will give your business the impression of being at the forefront of your industry, as well as driving up your organic ranking through the flow of relevant traffic.
